       <h1>About</h1>

       <h3> &bull; The setting for this Historic place is a functioning cemetery residing on 23 acres of land.
        Roughly 23,500 burial plots make up the cemetery, many of which belong to veterans.
        As such, special programs are presented on both Memorial day as well as Veteran's day.
    </h3>

        <h3> &bull; The American Fork Cemetery Rock Wall was built in
            1937 and 1938 as a work for the WPA (Works Progress Administration)
            as a form of relief from the Great Depression. It does, however, only span two
            sides of the cemetery: the south and east. The stones are from the surrounding area and are mostly quartzite, sandstone, and marble. 
        </h3>

        <h3> &bull; The wall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
        </h3>

        <h3> &bull; The wall historically was used to employ people in Utah, seeing as we had one
             of the worst unemployment rates in the country. Currently, however, the Rock Wall is used
              just as that: A cemetery wall with great historic value.
        </h3>

        <h3> &bull; The rock wall is accessible to the public! No appointment or contact necessary.
            </h3>

         <h3> &bull; American Fork Cemetery is located at 26 W. 600 N.
